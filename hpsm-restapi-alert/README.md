# AppDynamics HP Service Manager REST API Alerting Extension

##Use Case
HP Service Manager (HPSM) now part of MicroFocus ([https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/products/service-management-automation-suite/overview](https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/home)) is a IT service management (ITSM) Tool using ITIL framework providing a web interface for Corporate changes, releases and interactions supported by a Service Catalog and CMDB. AppDynamics integrates directly with HPSM to create tickets in response to alerts. With the HPSM integration you can leverage your existing incident management infrastructure to notify your operations team to resolve performance degradation issues.

**Note**: This extension works with both AppDynamics Health Rule Violation events and Other Events. Auto close of incidents is only for Health Rule Voilations and Other Events incidents are not auto closed.

##Prerequisites

To post events to HPSM an Operator User should have restful capability. For details refer to HP Service Manager Web Services (https://docs.microfocus.com/SM/9.41/Codeless/Content/Resources/PDF_PD/HP_Service_Manager_Web_Services_codeless.pdf)

##Installation Steps

 1. Run "mvn clean install"

 2. Find the zip file at 'target/hpsm-restapi-alert.zip'.

 3. Unzip the hpsm-restapi-alert.zip file into <CONTROLLER_HOME_DIR>/custom/actions/ . You should have  <CONTROLLER_HOME_DIR>/custom/actions/hpsm-restapi-alert created.

 4. Check if you have custom.xml file in <CONTROLLER_HOME_DIR>/custom/actions/ directory. If yes, add the following xml to the <custom-actions> element.

   ```
      <action>
		<type>hpsm-restapi-alert</type>
		<!-- For Linux/Unix *.sh -->
		<executable>hpsm-alert.sh</executable>
		<!-- For windows *.bat -->
		<!--<executable>hpsm-alert.bat</executable>-->
	  </action>
  ```

   If you don't have custom.xml already, create one with the below xml content

      ```
      <custom-actions>
          <action>
            <type>hpsm-restapi-alert</type>
            <!-- For Linux/Unix *.sh -->
            <executable>hpsm-alert.sh</executable>
            <!-- For windows *.bat -->
            <!--<executable>hpsm-alert.bat</executable>-->
          </action>
      </custom-actions>
      ```
      Uncomment the appropriate executable tag based on windows or linux/unix machine.

    5. Update the config.yaml file in <CONTROLLER_HOME_DIR>/custom/actions/hpsm-restapi-alert/conf/ directory with the domain, username, password and serviceNowVersion. You can also configure the default service now details like assignmentGroup, assignedTo, callerId, category, location.

 6. Check if the version of java in your environment is 1.8 and above. If not download the latest 1.8 Java and provide the path in the hpsm-alert.bat/hpsm-alert.sh as applicable 

###Note
Please make sure to not use tab (\t) while editing yaml files. You may want to validate the yaml file using a yaml validator http://yamllint.com/

###Password Encryption
To set passwordEncrypted in config.yaml, follow the steps below:

1. Download the util jar to encrypt the password from [here](https://github.com/Appdynamics/maven-repo/blob/master/releases/com/appdynamics/appd-exts-commons/1.1.2/appd-exts-commons-1.1.2.jar).
2. Run command:

   	~~~   
   	java -cp appd-exts-commons-1.1.2.jar com.appdynamics.extensions.crypto.Encryptor EncryptionKey CredentialToEncrypt
   	
   	For example: 
   	java -cp "appd-exts-commons-1.1.2.jar" com.appdynamics.extensions.crypto.Encryptor test password
   
   	~~~
   	
3. Set the resulting encrypted password in passwordEncrypted field and the encryption key used in encryptionKey field in config.yaml file

Note: This alerting extension is based on the existing https://github.com/Appdynamics/servicenow-api-alerting-extension. Thanks to the authors of the extension!
